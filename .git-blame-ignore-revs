# Ignore these commits when running `git blame`.
#
# This file lists commit hashes that should be ignored by `git blame`.
# These revisions usually consist of code formatting changes.
#
# To enable this locally, run this command once in your terminal:
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs

# --- INSTRUCTIONS ---
# - Precede each commit hash with a comment containing the first line of its commit message.
# - Append new commits to the bottom of the file in chronological order.
# - Use the full 40-character hash, not a short hash.
